# Select Ternary-Input Binary-Output Kronecker-Reed-Muller Forms using Grover's Quantum Search Algorithm

Qiskit Simulations created in Summer 2021 and improved in March 2022 for research regarding the paper "Quantum Machine Learning, Logic Minimization, and Circuit Design by Optimizing Ternary-Input Binary-Output Kronecker Reed-Muller Forms" in the Journal of Applied Logics for a Special Issue on Multiple Valued Logic. Due to the increased length, processing time, and complexity of a circuit that would encompass all ternary-input binary-output expansions, only 8 of the 28 expansions were chosen to be simulated for two-variable functions by Qiskit.

"An argument can be made that, similarly as a binary FPRM does not include all the binary expansions but is still popularly used by computer scientists and engineers, selecting only some and not all of the ternary expansions in our circuit simulation, though not generating the exact minimal results, will still be sufficient for optimization. Therefore, we have programmed an algorithm that utilizes all binary controls. In addition, the method can be repeated many times with the selection of various subsets of polarity kernels in variables."
